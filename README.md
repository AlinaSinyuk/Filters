Description:
Let me introduce my final project for CS50.
I created a special site where you can use different filters to make your picture more beautiful. The site was created with using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Also I used the special element of HTML which named Canvas. This element is designed to create graphics with using JavaScript. For example, it is allow to draw graphs, create photo compositions, animations and even process video in real time.
If you want to apply a filter for your foto, firstly you need to load your picture to the site. After that you can use 6 main filters: 
1. GrayScale - will make your foto in shade of two colours namely white and gray.
2. Sepia - will make your foto in shade of brown.
3. Blur - will make your foto more blurry.
4. Brightness - will make your foto more bright.
5. Rotate Left - allow to rotate your foto counterclockwise.
6. Rotate Right - allow to rotate your foto clockwise.
Only you need is to press buttons with name of filters at the top of the page. If you want to reset filter, please press button "Original". Picture with a filter you can save to your desktop by pressing right button of the mouse and choose "Save image as...".
Enjoy your new great picture!
